Here is my 2nd advanced project I created on Terraform using AWS here I first had to specify the AWS Provider configuration used to fine-tune the crucial needs for specifying which region and version of terraform to use and The modular structure of the Terraform code, I organized into distinct files for variables, network, autoscaling, load balancing, and providers, enhances clarity and maintainability. 
I established a rock-solid foundation, beginning with a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) this is to isolate my resources and equipped with two strategically placed subnets—one public and one private—spread across different availability zones in AWS.

The public subnet benefit from direct internet access through an Internet Gateway, while the private subnet relies on a NAT Gateway for secure internet connectivity. Security groups have been meticulously configured to control inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring a robust yet flexible environment.
To enhance this even further and meet with application scaling demands I've implemented an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) backed by a launch template. 

This template defines the blueprint for the instances, specifying details like instance type and the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use. The ASG dynamically adjusts the number of instances based on demand, ensuring optimal performance.

I also addressed the crucial need for load balancing and traffic distribution in which I’ve incorporated Application Load Balancer (ALB). This ALB collaborates with a target group, efficiently managing the traffic flow to our instances. This architecture guarantees both scalability and high availability for our application.
this Terraform project offers a robust, scalable, and highly available infrastructure in AWS.
